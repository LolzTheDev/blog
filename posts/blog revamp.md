# Blog Revamp

Look, hear me out. I know nothing visually changed for the user, but at the same time, *things did change*.

## What changed?

So, now there's a new themes feature! You can find this on the bottom of the sidebar. There will be four themes added over the course of this week/next week.

The theme selector's css is not finished, so I apologize if it looks ugly at the moment.

The new themes will be as follows:

- Dark (default)
- Light
- Catppuccin Mocha
- One Dark

(In order of priority)

Other than that, there is now a proper favicon and a new font - Space Mono. Monospaced fonts just look nicer on blogs that are (mostly) about programming.

Thanks for tuning into this post! (Is that a good outro...?)
