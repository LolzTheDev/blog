# Project Dilemma

So, now that I have a blog, domain, and portfolio (sorta), I need to find out what I should actually create and deploy. Obviously I want to make something meaningful, but something that won't take too long. Something short, simple, and good.

My current ideas are:
- Rewriting the UI of this blog
- Creating a clicker game
- Creating a web framework (maybe)
- Making a subdomain listing (for my site)
- Creating a CDN
- Making a Discord bot

All of these ideas seem nice, except for Rrewriting this blog... since I need a break from doing ANYTHING involving building upon this blog's codebase.

## Evaluation

These projects are all nice, but I've chosen the top two most useful ones:
1. a CDN (very useful, important, and cool)
2. a subdomain listing (pretty useful, good)

If I go with #2, it would probably be on the subdomain sites.zirc.lol, if I go with #1 it would obviously be cdn.zirc.lol, and would be used to keep my scripts and CSS stuff.

I could also finish this blog's API... but I think I'll pass on that ~~for now~~.
