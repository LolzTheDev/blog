# Buying a domain...

Today I bought my first ever domain, zirc.lol - and there was some stuff I knew before hand...

1. Apparently, PorkBun does not have a cool dashboard (mega loss)
2. I should probably learn more about how domains work (dns stuff)
3. Not sure why I made a list for only 2 things

## Why did I want a domain?
I wanted to host cool projects and stuff, but the host I use (render.com), has a pretty goofy domain (example.onrender.com), which I personally didn't like.

My solution? Buy a sick domain! Now I will be able to host a lot of projects on subdomains!!!

## Do you actually know anything about records...?
No. I just guessed and messed around until I found out how to work with it.

## Why zirc.lol?
So, my (new) online alias is zirconium (or zirc), and zirc sounded short and easy to remember. The cheapest TLD (first year) was .LOL and I actually thought it looked decent so I bought it.

Yes, I did buy it the second I found it.
